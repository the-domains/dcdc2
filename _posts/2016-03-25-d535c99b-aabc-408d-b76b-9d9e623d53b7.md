Good Friday was a no wind day and the opening day of New Forest Wakepark.

The Kicker layout has changed with the addition of new obstacles I'm way to chicken to hit. 

I was riding in my shorty and it is a bit chilly but I didn't care coz the ride is so good but in all honestly my Christmas belly is killing my fitness and wakeboarding demands fitness.
