**Hillhead - Salters Park & Ice Cream Van**

There are two spots at Hillhead, Salters Park and the Ice Cream Van on Cliff Road. Both spots have free parking and are at their best two hours outside of high tide.

At Salters you'll rig up on the grass park and you need to hop over the wall before dropping onto the beach and this manoeuvre can be a bit sketchy. You'll need to beware of slipping on the wet grass especially in booty's. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/add33b78-1cca-427b-be2c-4f33299f6af5.jpg)

Salters is often a few knots less than the Ice Cream van as the wind channels between the island and the mainland accelerating the wind speed. In a South Westerly the wind is dead onshore allowing you to ride up the coastline on superbly long tacks. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b870b58d-824f-404b-9e94-0b7bf7d57655.png)

Salters is often a few knots less than the Ice Cream van as the wind channels between the island and the mainland accelerating the wind speed. 

In a South Westerly the swell flows straight on to the beach allowing you to ride in the troughs in smooth water between the rollers.
